/**
 * A nominally typed, one-shot async value that supports `await` but enforces infallibility.
 *
 * Two design choices work together to make the guarantee structural rather than documentary:
 *
 * - The phantom `[_deferred]` symbol makes the type **nominal**: only values produced by
 *   `Deferred.fromPromise` satisfy it. A plain object `{ then: ... }` does not.
 * - The single-parameter `.then()` **excludes rejection handlers** by construction. There is
 *   no second argument to pass, so chaining and `.catch()` are impossible.
 *
 * This makes `Deferred<A>` the natural return type for `Task<A>`, which is guaranteed to
 * never reject.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const value = await Deferred.fromPromise(Promise.resolve(42));
 * // value === 42
 * ```
