import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Precise types" >
    Replace `T | null`, `try/catch`, and loading state flag soup with types that make valid states explicit and invalid ones unrepresentable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent API" >
    Every type follows the same conventions — `map`, `chain`, `match`, `getOrElse`. Learn one, pick up the rest quickly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composition first" >
    All operations are designed to work with `pipe` and `flow`. Logic reads top to bottom, in the order it executes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No FP jargon" >
    No `Monad`, `Functor`, or `Applicative` in the API. Just names that describe what they do.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
