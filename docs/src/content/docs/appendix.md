This page is for readers who want to understand the library at a deeper level — the decisions behind the API, the structural patterns used throughout, and the prior work that shaped them. None of this is required to use the library effectively. Think of it as the author's notes at the back of the book.

## Where the ideas come from

### Haskell

Most of the core types in this library descend, in some form, from Haskell. `Maybe` became `Option`, `Either` became `Result`, and the `IO` type — a lazy, composable wrapper around side effects — inspired `Task`. The naming convention of `map`, `chain`, and `fold` follows Haskell's vocabulary (translated from `fmap`, `>>=`, and `foldr` into names that describe what they do rather than where they come from).

`These` comes directly from a Haskell library of the same name by Edward Kmett. It represents the inclusive-OR case: a value that can carry an error, a result, or both simultaneously — which neither `Either` nor a tuple cleanly expresses.

### Elm

Elm deserves particular credit for two things. First, it took the `Maybe` and `Result` types from Haskell and gave them an API that felt natural to people without a Haskell background — friendly, named, and consistent. That accessibility is something this library tries to maintain.

Second, Elm is where `RemoteData` as a named pattern originated, in a package by Kris Jenkins. The insight — that a data fetch has exactly four states, that those states are mutually exclusive, and that encoding them as a union type eliminates a whole class of bugs — predates this library by several years. The name, the four variants, and the motivation in the guide are all drawn from that original work.

### Rust

Rust brought `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` into the standard library of a mainstream systems language and proved that these types work outside academia. Seeing them become idiomatic in a performance-critical, widely-used language validated the premise that explicit absence and explicit failure are practical, not academic.

### fp-ts

The most direct TypeScript ancestor is [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) by Giulio Canti. fp-ts is a comprehensive, rigorous encoding of functional programming in TypeScript: it covers every major typeclass, uses `pipe` as its composition primitive, and follows the data-last convention throughout.

This library borrows several things from fp-ts directly: the `pipe` and `flow` functions, the data-last convention, and the pattern of defining each type as a TypeScript type alias alongside a namespace of functions with the same name. The key differences are scope and vocabulary. fp-ts covers far more ground, uses precise typeclass names (`Functor`, `Monad`, `Applicative`), and is designed for users who are already familiar with functional programming. This library covers a smaller surface area and uses names that describe behaviour rather than algebraic structure.

## Structural principles

### Tagged unions

Every core type in this library is a discriminated union — a union of object types, each distinguished by a literal `kind` field:

```ts
type Option<A> =
  | { kind: "Some"; value: A }
  | { kind: "None" }

type Result<E, A> =
  | { kind: "Ok";    value: A }
  | { kind: "Error"; error: E }

type RemoteData<E, A> =
  | { kind: "NotAsked" }
  | { kind: "Loading"  }
  | { kind: "Failure"; error: E }
  | { kind: "Success"; value: A }
```

This representation has several properties that make it well-suited for TypeScript:

- **Exhaustiveness checking**: A `switch` or `match` over `kind` that handles every variant satisfies the compiler. If a new variant is added to the type, every existing `match` becomes a type error until the new case is handled.
- **Transparency**: The structure is plain data. You can inspect it with `console.log`, serialize it with `JSON.stringify`, and pattern-match it without any class machinery.
- **No prototype chain**: There's nothing to inherit, override, or accidentally mutate. The operations live in separate namespace modules, not on the objects themselves.

The alternative — class-based encoding — would use `instanceof` for dispatch and method definitions for operations. This has appeal, but it couples operations to types (adding a method means touching the class), makes the types opaque (you can't pattern-match without the class being in scope), and ties the library to a specific instantiation model.

### InternalTypes

The four types in `InternalTypes.ts` are the structural vocabulary of the entire library:

```ts
type WithKind<K extends string>  = { readonly kind: K }
type WithValue<T>                = { readonly value: T }
type WithError<T>                = { readonly error: T }
type WithErrors<T>               = { readonly errors: NonEmptyList<T> }
```

These ensure that field names are consistent across every type in the library. The success payload is always named `value`. A single failure is always named `error`. Multiple accumulated failures are always named `errors`, and the type of `errors` is always `NonEmptyList` — guaranteeing at least one error exists when a type is in an invalid state.

This consistency matters at runtime too: `Option.map` and `Result.map` and `RemoteData.map` all look for `.value` to find the success payload. Sharing the field name is what makes this uniform without code duplication.

### The namespace pattern

Each type is defined as a pair: a TypeScript type alias and a namespace with the same name:

```ts
export type Option<A> = Some<A> | None;

export namespace Option {
  export const of   = <A>(value: A): Option<A> => ({ kind: "Some", value });
  export const map  = <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (opt: Option<A>): Option<B> => ...
  export const fold = ...
}
```

A single import gives you both:

```ts
import { Option } from "@nlozgachev/pipekit/Core";

const x: Option<number> = Option.of(42); // type and constructor from the same import
```

The namespace acts like a module — a flat collection of named functions. There's no class, no prototype, no `this`. The functions are just functions; they happen to share a namespace prefix that signals they operate on the same type.

This pattern also means the operations are tree-shakeable. If your bundler can tell that `Option.filter` is never called, it can exclude it from the bundle. Method-on-class approaches don't give bundlers the same opportunity because the method is attached to the prototype at definition time.

### Data-last convention

Every operation in the library takes the data it operates on as the **last** argument. Comparing signatures:

```ts
// data-first (not used here)
map(option, f)

// data-last (used throughout)
map(f)(option)
```

With data-last, the function is curried: calling `map(f)` without the data returns a new function that accepts the data. This is what makes `pipe` and `flow` compose cleanly:

```ts
pipe(
  Option.of(5),
  Option.map(n => n * 2),   // map(n => n * 2) is already a function Option<number> → Option<number>
  Option.getOrElse(0),
);
```

Without data-last, each `pipe` step would need to be wrapped in an arrow function:

```ts
pipe(
  Option.of(5),
  opt => Option.map(opt, n => n * 2),  // awkward — two arguments, data first
  opt => Option.getOrElse(opt, 0),
);
```

The convention is a direct import from fp-ts, which in turn took it from Haskell and OCaml.

### Error type as the first type parameter

`Result<E, A>` puts the error type before the value type. Same for `Validation<E, A>` and `RemoteData<E, A>`. This is the opposite of many TypeScript APIs and feels counterintuitive at first glance.

The reason is about which type parameter `map` should transform. `map` transforms the success value — the `A`. For TypeScript to infer this correctly when you write `Result.map(f)`, `A` needs to be the "last" type parameter in the sense that it's the one that varies across a `map` operation. Putting `E` first keeps it stable while `A` changes — the same reason Haskell's `Either` is `Either e a` with `e` first and `a` last.

In practice this rarely matters for reading type signatures: once you've seen `Result<string, User>` a few times, you read it as "can fail with string, succeeds with User" and the ordering is automatic.

### NonEmptyList as a structural guarantee

`Validation` uses `NonEmptyList<E>` (defined as `readonly [E, ...E[]]`) for the errors field instead of `E[]`. This is a structural guarantee: when a value is `Invalid`, it always has at least one error. An `Invalid` with zero errors is a contradiction — it can't be represented.

This matters for consumers of the `invalid` branch. If `errors` were `E[]`, every handler would need to guard against the empty case even though it's semantically impossible. With `NonEmptyList`, you can call `errors[0]` or `errors.join(", ")` without defensive checks.

## What was deliberately left out

**Typeclass names.** The library contains implementations of what Haskell calls `Functor` (`map`), `Monad` (`chain`), and `Applicative` (`ap`). These names don't appear in the API because they convey structure to people who already know what they mean, and nothing to people who don't. `map` says what it does; `fmap` says what it is. The first is more useful at a glance.

**A typeclass system.** fp-ts uses a `HKT` encoding to simulate higher-kinded types in TypeScript, which allows generic code over any type that implements a given typeclass. This library makes no attempt at that. The `map` on `Option` and the `map` on `Result` share a naming convention, not a shared interface. This is a real limitation — you can't write a function that works generically over "any type with a `map`" — but the tradeoff is a much simpler type system with no encoding overhead.

**Classes and `extends`.** Every type is plain data. There's no inheritance hierarchy and no `instanceof` checks in user-facing code.

**Runtime overhead for brands.** `Brand<K, T>` exists only as a compile-time phantom. At runtime, a branded value is exactly the underlying value — no wrapper object, no tag field, no extra allocation. The brand is erased entirely by the TypeScript compiler. `Brand.wrap` and `Brand.unwrap` are identity functions at runtime; their only job is to satisfy the type checker.

## Acknowledgements

None of this exists in a vacuum.

The ideas behind this library were worked out over years of reading code written by people who thought carefully about these problems — the Haskell community's decades of refining abstractions down to their most composable form; the Elm community's insistence that good ideas should be approachable; the fp-ts contributors who did the genuinely hard work of encoding those ideas faithfully in TypeScript.

Particular thanks to Giulio Canti, whose fp-ts library is the clearest demonstration that typed functional programming is practical in TypeScript — and whose source code taught me more about the language than any tutorial. To Kris Jenkins, for naming `RemoteData` and making the case so clearly that the pattern spread beyond Elm. To Edward Kmett, for `These` and for an enormous body of work that keeps the Haskell ecosystem moving forward. And to the TypeScript team, for building a type system expressive enough that most of these ideas can be encoded at all.

If you've read this far, thank you for your curiosity. Whether you found the library useful, built something interesting with it, spotted something wrong, or just wanted to understand how the pieces fit together — that kind of engagement is what makes writing software for others worthwhile.

Write good code. Make the impossible states unrepresentable. Happy coding.
