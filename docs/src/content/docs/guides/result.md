title: Result — handling failures
description: Model operations that can fail without try/catch scattered across your code.
---

Every function that can fail has two possible outcomes, but only one is in the type signature. The error leaks out as an exception — invisible to callers, untraceable through the type system. `Result<E, A>` puts both outcomes in the type. Callers know an operation can fail, the compiler tracks what's handled, and errors compose the same way values do.

## The problem with exceptions

`try/catch` has a fundamental issue: nothing in the type of a function tells you it can throw. A function typed as `(s: string) => number` might throw at runtime, but the type gives no hint. Every caller has to either know this and wrap in try/catch, or learn the hard way.

This leads to one of two outcomes — either error handling is scattered across every call site:

```ts
let result: number;
try {
  result = parseInput(raw);
} catch (e) {
  result = 0;
}
```

Or it's skipped entirely and exceptions bubble up to a top-level handler that can't do anything meaningful with them.

## The Result approach

With `Result`, the possibility of failure is part of the type. A function that might fail returns `Result<E, A>` instead of `A`. The error type `E` is explicit — callers know exactly what can go wrong:

```ts
import { Result } from "@nlozgachev/pipekit/Core";
import { pipe } from "@nlozgachev/pipekit/Composition";

declare function parseInput(raw: string): Result<string, number>;

const value = pipe(
  parseInput(raw),
  Result.map((n) => n * 2),    // only runs if parsing succeeded
  Result.getOrElse(0),          // provides the fallback
);
```

The `map` step only runs if `parseInput` returned `Ok`. If it returned `Err`, the error flows through unchanged to `getOrElse`, which provides the fallback. No try/catch. No conditional checks.

## Creating Results

```ts
Result.toOk(42);           // Ok(42)  — a successful result
Result.toErr("not found"); // Err("not found") — a failure
Result.of(42);             // Ok(42)  — alias for toOk
```

The error type in `Result<E, A>` can be anything — a string, a discriminated union, an Error object. You choose what fits your domain.

### Wrapping throwing code with `tryCatch`

When working with APIs that throw (like `JSON.parse`), `tryCatch` converts a throwing function into a `Result`:

```ts
const parseJson = (s: string): Result<string, unknown> =>
  Result.tryCatch(
    () => JSON.parse(s),
    (e) => `Invalid JSON: ${e}`,
  );

parseJson('{"ok": true}'); // Ok({ ok: true })
parseJson("not json");     // Err("Invalid JSON: ...")
```

The second argument maps the caught exception to your error type, so the result is typed correctly.

## Transforming values with `map`

`map` transforms the success value, leaving `Err` untouched:

```ts
pipe(Result.toOk(5),       Result.map((n) => n * 2)); // Ok(10)
pipe(Result.toErr("oops"), Result.map((n) => n * 2)); // Err("oops")
```

Chaining multiple `map` calls only continues while the result remains `Ok`. The first `Err` short-circuits the rest:

```ts
pipe(
  parseJson(input),
  Result.map((data) => data.userId),
  Result.map((id) => users.get(id)),
  Result.getOrElse(null),
);
```

## Transforming errors with `mapError`

`mapError` is the counterpart to `map` — it transforms the error value, leaving `Ok` untouched:

```ts
pipe(
  Result.toErr("connection refused"),
  Result.mapError((e) => ({ code: 503, message: e })),
); // Err({ code: 503, message: "connection refused" })
```

This is useful for normalizing errors from different sources into a single error type before they reach the boundary of your system.

## Chaining with `chain`

When a transformation might itself fail, use `chain` instead of `map`. It prevents nested `Result<E, Result<E, A>>`:

```ts
const validatePositive = (n: number): Result<string, number> =>
  n > 0 ? Result.toOk(n) : Result.toErr("Must be positive");

pipe(Result.toOk(5),  Result.chain(validatePositive)); // Ok(5)
pipe(Result.toOk(-1), Result.chain(validatePositive)); // Err("Must be positive")
pipe(Result.toErr("parse failed"), Result.chain(validatePositive)); // Err("parse failed")
```

A typical pipeline chains multiple steps that can each fail independently:

```ts
pipe(
  parseInput(raw),            // Result<string, string>
  Result.chain(validateRange), // Result<string, number>
  Result.chain(lookupRecord),  // Result<string, Record>
  Result.map((r) => r.name),  // Result<string, string>
  Result.getOrElse("Unknown"),
);
```

If any step returns `Err`, subsequent steps are skipped and the error propagates to the end.

## Extracting the value

**`getOrElse`** — provide a fallback for the error case:
```ts
pipe(Result.toOk(5),       Result.getOrElse(0)); // 5
pipe(Result.toErr("oops"), Result.getOrElse(0)); // 0
```

**`match`** — handle each case explicitly:
```ts
pipe(
  result,
  Result.match({
    ok:  (value) => `Success: ${value}`,
    err: (error) => `Failed: ${error}`,
  }),
);
```

**`fold`** — same as `match` but with positional arguments (error handler first, success handler second):
```ts
pipe(
  result,
  Result.fold(
    (error) => `Failed: ${error}`,
    (value) => `Success: ${value}`,
  ),
);
```

## Recovering from errors

`recover` provides a fallback `Result` when the current one is `Err`. Unlike `getOrElse`, the fallback is itself a `Result` — useful when the recovery operation might also fail:

```ts
pipe(
  fetchFromPrimary(url),
  Result.recover(() => fetchFromFallback(url)),
  Result.getOrElse(cachedValue),
);
```

`recoverUnless` lets you recover from all errors except one specific case — useful when one error type means "stop trying":

```ts
pipe(
  authenticate(token),
  Result.recoverUnless("REVOKED", () => refreshAndRetry(token)),
);
```

## Converting to Option

When you only care about whether an operation succeeded — not why it failed — convert to `Option`:

```ts
Result.toOption(Result.toOk(42));      // Some(42)
Result.toOption(Result.toErr("oops")); // None
```

The error is discarded. Use this at boundaries where you want to fall back to `Option`-based logic.

## When to use Result vs try/catch

Use `Result` when:
- The function is part of a pipeline and callers need to compose over success or failure
- Multiple operations can fail and you want a single linear flow rather than nested try/catch
- The error type matters — you want callers to know what can go wrong from the type signature alone

Keep using try/catch when:
- You're handling truly unexpected runtime errors (out of memory, unrecoverable state)
- You're at the very top of the call stack and just need to log and exit
- You're interfacing with code that expects exceptions (use `tryCatch` at the boundary to convert back to `Result`)
